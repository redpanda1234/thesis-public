We record some notational conventions used throughout this document.
First, a note on some non-standard glyphs:
\begin{leftbar}
  \textbf{Note:} we will sometimes make use of glyphs from the two
  Japanese phonetic alphabet systems, \hiragana\ (IPA:\footnote{See
    \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International\_Phonetic\_Alphabet}{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International\_Phonetic\_Alphabet}
    and
    \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Japanese}{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Japanese}}
  \ipa{\c{c}iRaga\textdownstep na}) and \katakana\ (IPA:
  \ipa{kataka\textdownstep na}). The motivation is that (a) more
  commonly-employed glyph systems (e.g., Greek / Roman) are heavily
  overloaded in mathematics, and (b) the \hiragana\ characters $つ$,
  $の$, $ゆ$, and $め$ look qualitatively similar to
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Planar isotopy (つ),
    \item Reidemeister I (の),
    \item Reidemeister II (ゆ), and
    \item Reidemeister III (め)
  \end{itemize}
  respectively, so they seemed a convenient alternative in the
  context of knot theory.

  It's worth mentioning that it's possible to typeset these symbols
  without having to use \XeLaTeX\ or \LuaLaTeX\ by using the
  \texttt{newunicodechar} package and manually specifying the code
  point in \texttt{udmj30}.\footnote{See
    \href{https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/171614}{https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/171614}}
  The author has made a small package for \LaTeX\ that does this; it

\subsection*{Flipbook}
A flipbook showing the construction of a $(7,2)$ knot has been
provided in the right margin for the reader's entertainment.


\subsection*{Document Formatting}\label{pref:formatting}
Throughout this document we will occasionally use a \emph{leftbar}
environment to visually distinguish some parts of the document from
others. E.g., in providing a recap of a series of proofs, we might do
something like
\begin{leftbar}
  \textbf{Recap:} The above results are rather technical, but they are
  important because Lemma 1 gives [\ldots], which will allow us to
  show [\ldots] later.
\end{leftbar}
If pursuing an iff proof, it will likely be formatted as follows:
\begin{iffproof}
  \item We want to show $A \implies B$. [\ldots]
  \item We want to show $B \implies A$. [\ldots]
\end{iffproof}
We mentioned this in the notation table, but we'll do so here again.
Sometimes, if there is a particularly nasty-to-parse noun phrase,
we'll wrap it in \np{tortoise shell brackets}\footnote{きっこ
  う(\ipa{kik\textcorner k\|`o:}).} to make the sentence easier to
read (we hope).

Finally, wherever possible, we have sought to insert hyperlinks for
cross-referenced material (e.g., theorems, citations, equations, etc.)
so that readers using a PDF copy can navigate it more easily. The
coloring scheme is the default for the \texttt{hyperref} package,
which is as follows.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Red for {\color{red} linkcolor},
  \item Black for {\color{black} anchorcolor},
  \item Green for {\color{green} citecolor},
  \item Cyan for {\color{cyan} filecolor},
  \item Red again for {\color{red} menucolor},
  \item Cyan again for {\color{cyan} runcolor}, and
  \item Magenta for {\color{magenta} urlcolor}.
\end{itemize}

% The idea is to take a
% sequence of nested closed neighborhoods


%  set our attention on
% trying to understand existing literature on wild knots

% This led to a deep dive into the relationships between topological
% knots and their diagrams.

% Hence, phase II of the thesis could be best described as
% \begin{enumerate}[label=(\arabic*)]
%   \item
% \end{enumerate}

% The first plan of attack was to try and find a flaw in the uniform
% convergence argument. One was not immediately obvious to us, although
% this does not mean an error does not exist. Hence, we turned to


% As it turned out, this was also quite ambitious. In the past century
% almost all of the focus of the discipline of Knot Theory has been on
% tame knots. This presents a problem for our purposes,


% Of course, we claim that the example given above \emph{is
%   tame as well} --- the problem is that


% This led to a \emph{deep} foray into the foundations of knot theory,
% to find where the inconsistency lay.

% In particular, our example seemed to suggest an inconsistency between
% (\cref{def:cdef1}) and (\cref{def:cdef2} and \cref{def:cdef3}). To the
% best of our knowledge, this is not actually the case --- rather, the
% confusion seems to arise from hidden hypotheses and/or collisions in
% vocabulary. In \cref{def:cdef1}, we start with an arbitrary embedding
% $K : S^1 \into \RR^3$. In \cref{def:cdef2} and (with some further
% clarifying additions) \cref{def:cdef3}, we're implicitly working in
% the \emph{smooth} category --- meaning we require the knot $K$ to have
% a well-defined tangent vector at every point. This precludes
% embeddings like the one shown in \cref{fig:pref-strange-unknot}; it's
% unclear how to specify a well-defined tangent vector at the limit
% point of the loops.



% The loop nonsense above IS locally flat.

% For S^1 -> R^3, tame implies locally flat
% Hence, not locally flat -> not tame

% Part of the reason this took so long to discover was that as far as we
% can tell, the term \emph{piecewise linear} has been used
% inconsistently in the literature, {\color{green} and (worse still) on
%   StackOverflow!} In particular, sometimes the definition of
% \emph{piecewise-linear} is made in implicit reference to \emph{finite}
% simplicial complexes, and other times, it is made in reference to
% \emph{locally-finite} simplicial complexes.\footnote{If this is a
%   misunderstanding on the author's part, the reader is encouraged to
%   get in contact so that this characterization can be fixed!}


% But actually, the confusion doesn't stop there. As


% This
% led us to take an extended foray into the foundations of knot theory,
% ultimately shifting the focus of the project towards
% \begin{leftbar}
%   ``Seeking a better understanding of the relationships between knots
%   and knot diagrams, with a particular eye towards trying to find an
%   analog of Reidmeister's Theorem for wild knots.''
