    abstract = {Two properties of embeddings of simple closed curves in E3 are explored in this paper. Let S1 be a simple closed curve and f(S1) = S an embedding of S1 in E3. The simple closed curve S is homogeneously embedded or alternatively f is homogeneous if for any points p and q of S, there is an automorphism h of E3 such that h(S) = S and h(p) = q. The embedding f or the simple closed curve S is extendible if any automorphism of S extends to an automorphism of E3. Two classes of wild simple closed curves are constructed and are shown to be homogeneously embedded. A new example of an extendible simple closed curve is constructed. A theorem of H. G. Bothe about extending orientation-preserving automorphisms of a simple closed curve is generalized.},
