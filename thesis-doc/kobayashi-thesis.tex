%%% Abstract

\begin{abstract}
  The new work in this document can be broken down into two main
  parts.

  In the first, we introduce a formalism for viewing the \emph{signed
    Gauss code} for virtual knots in terms of an action of the
  symmetric group on a countable set. This is achieved by creating a
  ``standard unknot'' whose diagram contains countably-many crossings,
  and then representing tame knots in terms of the action of
  permutations with finite support; wild knots with topologically
  discrete crossing sets can be encoded by permutations for which the
  ``finite support'' condition is dropped. We present some preliminary
  computational results regarding the group operation given by this
  encoding, but do not explore it in detail. We then discuss some of
  the main challenges to working with this representation, and finish
  with a discussion of directions for future work.

  To make the encoding above formal, we require the aforementioned
  ``unknot with a countable sequence of crossings;'' building up the
  machinery to work with these kinds of objects is the focus of the
  second part of the project. Note that initially, the presence of
  infinitely-many crossing might appear to be a contradiction to the
  finiteness constraint in Reidemeister's theorem; we show that this
  is not the case, and introduce the notion of \emph{feral points} to
  represent areas of our diagrams in which it is not immediately
  obvious whether the knot is \emph{wild} or \emph{tame}. Our
  countable-crossing unknot possesses such a point. We employ uniform
  convergence to create sufficient conditions for guaranteeing the
  preservation of ambient isotopy under limits, and resolve a seeming
  contradiction given by the wild arc of Fox-Artin. Finally, we show
  that any knot (wild or tame) whose crossings are topologically
  discrete in a 2D diagram is ambient isotopic to a countable union of
  polygonal segments, and discuss implications for extending
  Reidemeister's theorem in this context.

  I am grateful to Edward P.\ Moore, my English teacher throughout
  much of high school. He never stopped believing in me or encouraging
  me to do the same. Thank you Mr.\ Moore --- I'm sorry about the page
  count. It seems that despite your best efforts, I still have a
  tendency to write a lot.

  Thank you to Professor Francis Su and Professor Sam Nelson for all
  their guidance throughout this project. And thank you to Professor
  Ken Fandell for encouraging me to view math (like art) as an
  opportunity for creativity and self-expression. Finally, thank you
  to all of the incredible professors I've had at the Claremont
  Colleges. Your dedication to your students and your work will always
  inspire me.
